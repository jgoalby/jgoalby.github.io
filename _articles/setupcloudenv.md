# Setting up your cloud development environment

How to set up an opinionated and specific development environment. This is a useful guide if you want to setup these exact things to work together as a single solution. Streamlit Community Cloud requires a github repository to deploy from, so that's why we start with setting up your github account. The other services are optional (but helpful) to getting Streamlit running. my use case is using an iPad exclusively so local instalation is not an option.

## Setup your GitHub account

You will need a GitHub account for deploying to Streamlit.

If you already have a GitHub setup, then you can move on to the next step.

This is the homepage for GitHub:
- <https://www.github.com/>

Private repos.

## GitHub basics

commit, then push

To create a folder in the web interface you specify the folder when you add a file. Add a file using the add file button, and then rather than giving a filename, specify the folder using a trailing slash, followed by the filename.

To rename a file in the web interface, edit the file and then specify a new name for it in the textbox above the edit area.
