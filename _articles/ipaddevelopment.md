# Why use an iPad for development?

Arguments against:
- I understand that many people think it is ridiculous to use the iPad for development
- The iPad is limited, mainly because of iPadOS as the hardware is very capable
- There is a limited selection of applications that can be run on iPadOS
- A lack of first-class IDEs
- Keyboard shortcuts are often limited

Arguments for:
- All day battery life
- No annoying fan noises
    - Mainly an issue with Windows based laptops
- Apps I use a lot and easy installation from the app store
- Portability and robustness
    - I am not as afraid of carrying it around with me as I am a full laptop
    - The iPad is not as heavy as most laptops
- Compatibility with iPhone including easy copy and paste of information
- My iPad is typically available wherever I am
- With cloud-based applications you don't need to install applications locallly
    - Cloud applications can be limited
- I suppose I should mention the Apple Pencil although I don't really use that for development, but the touch screen can be really useful at times
- Testing on an iPad while developing on the iPad can be useful if that is one of the platforms you plan to run on
