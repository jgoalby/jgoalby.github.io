# TODOs

- Do I need the scale for the camera?
- Maybe don't have a launch screen as I am using caching and have a splash screen in the game.
- Clean up manifest if possible. What fields and icons etc are really needed.

- What is the best way to get user input in Phaser 3?
- Currently do the dom stuff, but I wonder if that is optimal.
- Also I wonder if I can create more game looking assets for the input screen

- Fix errors in the javascript
  - this.sys.game.globals
- Should I need the .js in the imports?
- Convert to use typescript and github actions to compile?
  - https://putridparrot.com/blog/building-and-testing-typescript-code-using-github-actions/
  - https://github.com/marketplace/actions/typescript-build
- Extract colors as a constant especially the text colors
- Can the typescript types file be moved to lib?
  - Make sure that the types work when I move them
- Add a favicon
- Does jsconfig.json need to be in the root?
- Find something to replace bgmusic.ogg for bgMusic
- Can I replace paths with pathfinder?
- See if I can get full screen to work using F11
