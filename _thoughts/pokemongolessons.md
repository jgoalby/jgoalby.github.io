# TL;DR:
There's a lot to be learned from Pokémon Go as a product manager and developer.
- You don't have just one type of user. New users are very different than power users.
- Be careful fixing "bugs" that users come to rely on.
- Listen to your users and show that you are listening.
- There is no substitute for watching users use your product.

# Background
I have been playing Pokémon Go since it was released. I play it every day. It helps motivate me to go for a walk every day. I am invested in the game and like numerous things about it. However there are many things I wish were different. I doubt any of these things will change, but I feel that there are lessons that can be learned from my experience with the game.

Here are my observations and lessons learned from Pokémon Go in no particular order.

# Heal and Revive All
In the past few days Niantic has added buttons on the revive and heal screens to make reviving and healing multiple Pokémon at once easier. A button was added at the bottom of each screen. This is a welcome improvement. This shows that Niantic are making usability changes to improve gamers experience.

# Zygarde cells
You can follow a route to collect all of the Zygarde cells. I typically walk the same route at the same time each day. From what I can tell, the cells will only appear on a specific route 24 hours after you last received one. This means that if you walk a little earlier on the following day, you will not receive the reward. Effectively you have to finish your walk a little later than the previous day. Obviously this cannot be sustained and you will end up missing a day. In practice I run into this every couple of days. I could plan my walks to optimize for this, but I don't want to have that much structure over when I go for a walk.

What is the reason for this? Well, I don't know what the product team is thinking, but I presume they want to create scarcity in the game so that people keep playing it more. If you could get all of the cells you needed quickly, there would be less incentive to play the game.

However, having a 24 hour period creates the issue I outlined above. It would seem to me that this could be solved quite simply be creating a shorter period. Even 23 hours would work, although I don't see why it couldn't be 12 hours. People have to sleep after all. I just presume that 24 hours was chosen because it is a round number and it is easy to understand.

When you are designing a product you need to understand how people will use it. Even something as seemingly benign as a 24 hour window can be frustrating to your users.

# Postcard Management
When exchanging gifts you can save the postcard to an album. The album has a limit of a couple hundred items and can fill up quite quickly. You have to manage the items in the album otherwise you cannot save future postcards. Right now you have to select each postcard one by one to delete them. It would be better to be able to select all of the postcards at once to delete, or even better have a delete all button.

Postcard management is not the primary mechanism of the game so users should not really be spending time managing their postcard albums. By making this difficult It makes the feature more frustrating to use and less enjoyable.

# Purified Pokémon
Part of the allure of Pokémon Go is collecting all of the different types of Pokémon. There are many different types of Pokémon such as Shiny, Shadow, Purified, etc. In the Pokédex you can see the different types as collections. When viewing a Pokémon you can directly see if you have a Shiny or a Shadow version because the button shows an image of the resulting Pokémon. This is not the case for the purified Pokémon. To know if you have a purified version of a Pokémon you have to go to the Pokédex, change to the purified collection and search for that Pokémon. It would be much better if the purified Pokémon were shown on the buttons just like Shiny and Shadow versions.

# Scatterbugs and Vivillon are hard to distinguish
The Scatterbug Pokémon are all identical despite evolving into many different types of Vivillon. The Vivillon are different patterns and colors but it can still be difficult to distinguish them. You do get notified of the type of Scatterbug when you catch it, but that's the only in game indication of the habitat type. Your best bet is to tag the Pokémon at that point if you have a tag for each of the different habitats. It makes management of these Pokémon difficult.

I don't think it is intentional to make distinguishing these Pokémon difficult. When showing information in your applications, make sure it is clear what the user is looking at.

# Tag management
Applying a tag to a Pokémon is quite simple. You can select from a responsive list of tags that is quick to navigate. It was changed in the past from a slow list to a much snappier list. Managing the tags though still uses the slower clunkier list. Getting to the bottom of the list of tags is painful. This clunkiness is likely because in the tag page you can see a list of the Pokémon with that tag. That list is limited to 11 with a button to see all of the Pokémon with that tag. I think showing the 11 Pokémon with that tag as a preview is not helpful and being able to click the tag to see all of the Pokémon with that tag would be sufficient. You have to scroll manually to get back to the top of the tags. Reordering tags is really painful because of the clunkiness and because the each tag takes up a lot of room.

Obviously tag management is not a central part of the game and maybe doesn't get the usability attention that other areas may get. Even so, it is painful to organize tags and could be made much better with a simple change. Having a QA process for all areas of the game would improve areas like this, making simple usability changes.

If you want to add a new tag to Pokémon, you need to scroll down the list of existing tags to get to the Add New Tag option. That could be positioned at the top of the page next to the image of the Pokémon so that it doesn't take up room and is easier to access. Then once you create a new tag it is actually not added to the Pokémon automatically. Often I add a new tag and then forget to actually add it to the Pokémon. This could be solved many ways. Simply having 2 buttons for adding a new tag is one solution where one of the buttons specifically adds a new tag and assigns it to the Pokémon as part of the same step.

Note that you can only contribute to an individual Pokémon's Mega Level once per day. The help center tells you that. The game doesn't. No indication given when day ends or that there's a limitation.
