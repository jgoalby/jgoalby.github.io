# TL;DR:
There's a lot to be learned from Pokémon Go as a product manager and developer.
- You don't have just one type of user. New users are very different than power users.
- Be careful fixing "bugs" that users come to rely on.
- Listen to your users and show that you are listening.
- There is no substitute for watching users use your product.

# Background
I have been playing Pokémon Go since it was released. I play it every day. It helps motivate me to go for a walk every day. I am invested in the game and like numerous things about it. However there are many things I wish were different. I doubt any of these things will change, but I feel that there are lessons that can be learned from my experience with the game.

Here are my observations and lessons learned from Pokémon Go in no particular order.

# Zygarde cells
You can follow a route to collect all of the Zygarde cells. I typically walk the same route at the same time each day. From what I can tell, the cells will only appear on a specific route 24 hours after you last received one. This means that if you walk a little earlier on the following day, you will not receive the reward. Effectively you have to finish your walk a little later than the previous day. Obviously this cannot be sustained and you will end up missing a day. In practice I run into this every couple of days. I could plan my walks to optimize for this, but I don't want to have that much structure over when I go for a walk.

What is the reason for this? Well, I don't know what the product team is thinking, but I presume they want to create scarcity in the game so that people keep playing it more. If you could get all of the cells you needed quickly, there would be less incentive to play the game.

However, having a 24 hour period creates the issue I outlined above. It would seem to me that this could be solved quite simply be creating a shorter period. Even 23 hours would work, although I don't see why it couldn't be 12 hours. People have to sleep after all. I just presume that 24 hours was chosen because it is a round number and it is easy to understand.

When you are designing a product you need to understand how people will use it. Even something as seemingly benign as a 24 hour window can be frustrating to your users.
