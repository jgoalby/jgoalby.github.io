# TL;DR:
Andrej Karpathy released a 2 1/4 hour video on tokenization for GPTs. The details are fascinating if you are into that sort of thing. I am going to distill the video into a few bullet points. If you want to watch the whole thing you can find it at [Andrej Karpathy - Let's Build the GPT Tokenizer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%253DzduSFxRajkE)
